# GUI and Transcription Improvements

Developed with Anthropic Claude 3.7 with thinking


## GUI Enhancements

- Added a small visual audio indicator in the top-right corner of the text area
- Indicator appears only when audio is detected, providing subtle feedback without cluttering the interface
- Implemented an overlay approach to keep the indicator within the text area boundary
- Used consistent color scheme (green indicator matching the Start button)

## Transcription Improvements

- Added silence detection to prevent processing of empty audio chunks
- Enhanced the transcription prompt to explicitly avoid hallucinated phrases
- Modified Whisper model parameters (temperature=0.0, condition_on_previous_text=False) to reduce hallucinations
- Added post-processing filters to catch and remove common hallucinated phrases
- Implemented smoothing for the audio detection to create a more natural-looking indicator

## Development Path

Initially attempted to implement an audio level meter that would display real-time volume levels, but abandoned this approach because:
- The level meter was too large and didn't display properly when positioned on the right side
- The continuous updating of level values added complexity without significant benefit
- A simple binary indicator (audio detected/not detected) provided cleaner visual feedback

## To-Do List

- Improve behavior when there are long silences, especially when these silences extend across the 30-second processing chunks
- Address the occasional appearance of polite extraneous text despite our filtering (e.g., "thank you", "thanks for watching")
- Consider implementing adaptive silence thresholds based on ambient noise levels
- Optimize memory usage during long recording sessions
