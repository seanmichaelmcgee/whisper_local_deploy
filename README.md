## üîç Overview

This application provides real-time transcription of speech with a minimalist GTK interface. It's designed to be unobtrusive (stays on top with slight transparency) while efficiently transcribing speech in real-time using GPU acceleration when available.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time transcription** with OpenAI's Whisper model
- **GPU acceleration** for improved performance
- **Two recording modes**:
  - **Normal mode**: Processes audio in 30-second chunks with 1-second overlap
  - **Long recording mode**: Captures extended speech (up to 3 minutes) before processing
- **Optimized for technical vocabulary** with priming for programming/ML terminology
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (spacebar to toggle recording in normal mode)
- **Auto-clipboard copying** of transcriptions
- **Minimal, always-on-top UI** with transparency

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended but not required)
- GTK3 libraries
- FFmpeg

### Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 ffmpeg
   
   # macOS
   brew install pygobject3 gtk+3 ffmpeg
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python gui-v0.6.2.py
```

Controls:
- **Start**: Begin transcribing in normal mode
- **Long Record**: Begin extended recording session
- **Stop**: End recording and finalize transcription
- **Spacebar**: Toggle recording in normal mode

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gui-v0.6.2.py         # GTK user interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcriber_v8.py     # Whisper-based transcription engine
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Project dependencies
```

### Core Components

- **TranscriptionApp** (in gui-v0.6.2.py): Handles the GTK UI, button events, and UI updating
- **RealTimeTranscriber** (in transcriber_v8.py): Manages audio recording, processing, and transcription

## üîÆ Future Development

### Docker Containerization

The next development phase will focus on containerizing this application:

- Create a Dockerfile optimized for GPU passthrough
- Ensure CUDA compatibility in the container
- Minimize image size by removing unnecessary dependencies
- Add volume mounting for persistent storage of transcriptions
- Implement environment variables for configuration

### Other Planned Improvements

- Fine-tuning Whisper for specific domains or vocabularies
- Adding language support beyond English
- Implementing post-processing to improve grammar and remove filler words
- UI improvements including theme support
